KNN-Based Questions (Supervised Learning)  

1.   Predict Salary Range (Low, Medium, High)  
   Given additional features like   years of experience  , use KNN to classify a person’s salary into three categories:

     Low (< ₹60,000), Medium (₹60,000–₹90,000), High (> ₹90,000).

2.   Department Classification Using KNN  
   Assume each person belongs to a department (e.g., HR, IT, Sales). Train a KNN model to predict the department based on salary and experience.

3.   Find Similar Employees  
   Given a new employee with a salary of ₹88,000 and 5 years of experience, use KNN to find the 3 most similar employees in the dataset.

4.   Predict Name Similarity Group (Using Encoded Name Features)  
   Convert names into numerical features (e.g., name length, number of vowels). Use KNN to classify whether a new name is similar in pattern to an existing name.

5.   Predict Likelihood of Promotion Based on Salary and Experience  
   Assume you’ve added a “Promoted” column (yes/no). Use KNN to predict whether a new employee will be promoted based on salary and experience.

      K-Means Clustering Questions (Unsupervised Learning)  

6.   Group Employees by Salary Brackets  
   Use K-Means to cluster the dataset into 3 groups based on salary only. Analyze the average salary in each group.

7.   Cluster Employees Based on Synthetic Features  
   Add features like `years_of_experience` and `education_level` (encoded numerically). Use K-Means to segment the workforce into distinct employee groups.

8.   Visualize Clusters on a 2D Plot  
   Assuming you have 2D data (like salary vs experience), visualize K-means clusters and label the centroids.

9.   Determine Optimal K (Elbow Method)  
   Use the Elbow method to determine the best number of clusters based on the salary values.

10.   Cluster for Salary Benchmarking  
    After clustering, determine if any employees are significantly underpaid compared to their cluster average.KNN-Based Questions (Supervised Learning)
